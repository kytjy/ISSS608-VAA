This could be used to create shared points of reference, to leverage peer pressure and spur collaboration to act on the data. The goal of PISA was to help schools and policy makers shift from looking inward at each other within the same education system to looking outward: to teachers, schools and policy makers across the world.\n\n## 1.2 The Data\n\nThe data for this exercise is the **Student questionnaire data file** in SAS format, retrieved from [OECD's PISA 2022 Database](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/).\n\n![](images/PISA.PNG){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## 1.3 The Task\n\nUsing the **2022 Student Questionnaire Dataset**, this exercise aims to use appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods and ggplot2 functions to reveal:\n\n-   the distribution of [Singapore students']{.underline} performance in **mathematics, reading, and science**, and\n-   the relationship between these performances with **schools, gender and socioeconomic status** of the students.\n\n# 2 Loading Packages\n\n| **Library**                                                                                  | **Description**                                                                                               |\n|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/)                                                  | A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling. |\n| [**haven**](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)                                                    | To enable R to read and write various data formats such as SAS and SPSS.                                      |\n| [**DT**](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/)                                                      | To create interactive html tables.                                                                            |\n| [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/)                                       | For preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.                                                         |\n| [**ggthemes**](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/)       | Extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot2.                                                                  |\n| [**scales**](https://scales.r-lib.org/)                                                      | For data labels and annotations for ggplot2                                                                   |\n| [**ggpp**](https://docs.r4photobiology.info/ggpp/)                                           | For data labels and annotations for ggplot2.                                                                  |\n| [**ggridges**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html) | For plotting ridgeline plots                                                                                  |\n|                                                                                              |                                                                                                               |\n|                                                                                              |                                                                                                               |\n\n: {tbl-colwidths=\"\\[20,80\\]\"}\n\nThe code chunk below uses `p_load()` of [**pacman**](https://rpubs.com/akshaypatankar/594834) package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer.
