# 1 Learning Outcome

In this chapter, you will learn the basic principles and essential components of ggplot2. At the same time, you will gain hands-on experience on using these components to plot statistical graphics based on the principle of Layered Grammar of Graphics. By then end of this chapter you will be able to apply the essential graphical elements provided by ggplot2 to create elegant and yet functional statistical graphics. 

# 2 Getting Started

::: panel-tabset
## Installing and loading libraries

The code chunk below uses `p_load()` of [pacman](https://rpubs.com/akshaypatankar/594834) package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing Data

-   The code chunk below imports **exam_data.csv** into R environment by using [`read_csv()`](https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html) function of [**readr**](https://readr.tidyverse.org/) package.
-   **readr** is one of the tidyverse package.

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

## Understanding the Data

```{r}
summary(exam_data)
```

-   Year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school.
-   There are a total of seven attributes. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.
    -   Categorical attributes are: ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.
    -   Continuous attributes are: MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

# 3 Introducing ggplot

## 3.1 R Graphics vs ggplot

::: panel-tabset
## R Graphics

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

par(bg = "#f5f5f5")

hist(exam_data$MATHS, 
     ylab='Number of Students', 
     xlab='Score', 
     main='Distribution of Maths scores',
     col='#7F948F')
```

## ggplot2

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"

ggplot(data=exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=10, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="black", 
                 fill="#7F948F") +
#  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")+
  labs(x = "Score",
       y = "Number of Students",
       title = "Distribution of Maths scores")+
  #theme_grey()+
  theme(plot.background=element_rect(fill="#f5f5f5",colour="#f5f5f5"))
```

[Hadley Wickham](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/#comment-1745406157) argues that ggplot2 is preferred over the built-in plot function due to the following reason:

The transferable skills from ggplot2 are not the idiosyncrasies of plotting syntax, but a powerful way of thinking about visualisation, as a way of mapping between variables and the visual properties of geometric objects that you can perceive.

# 4 Grammar of Graphics

Grammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer.

Briefly, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.

## 4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics

![](layeredgrammarofgraphics.png){fig-align="center"}

-   **Data**: The dataset being plotted.
-   **Aesthetics**: Take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.
-   **Geometrics**: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line. Facets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).
-   **Statistics**: Statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).
-   **Coordinate systems** define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.
-   **Themes** modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background.

# 5 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Data

Let us call the `ggplot()` function using the code chunk below.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data)
```

-   A blank canvas appears.
-   ggplot() initializes a ggplot object.
-   The data argument defines the dataset to be used for plotting.
-   If the dataset is not already a data.frame, it will be converted to one by fortify().

# 6 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Aesthetic mappings

The aesthetic mappings take attributes of the data and and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colour, size, shape, or transparency. Each visual characteristic can thus encode an aspect of the data and be used to convey information.

All aesthetics of a plot are specified in the [`aes()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes.html) function call.

Code chunk below adds the aesthetic element into the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS))
```

ggplot includes the x-axis and the axis's label

# 7 Essential Grammatical Elements in ggplot2: Geom

Geometric objects are the actual marks we put on a plot, examples include:

-   *geom_point* for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)
-   *geom_line* for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)
-   *geom_smooth* for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)
-   *geom_bar* for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)
-   *geom_histogram* for drawing binned values (e.g.Â a histogram)
-   *geom_polygon* for drawing arbitrary shapes
-   *geom_map* for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).

A plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. You can add a geom to a plot using the + operator.

For complete list, please refer to [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms).

:::panel-tabset

## geom_bar

The code chunk below plots a bar chart by using [`geom_bar()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_bar.html).

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```

## geom_dotplot

In a dot plot, the width of a dot corresponds to the bin width (or maximum width, depending on the binning algorithm), and dots are stacked, with each dot representing one observation.

In the code chunk below, [`geom_dotplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_dotplot.html) of ggplot2 is used to plot a dot plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(dotsize=0.5)
```

The y scale is not very useful, in fact it is very misleading.



The code chunk below performs the following two steps:

-   `scale_y_continuous()` is used to turn off the y-axis, and
-   *binwidth argument* is used to change the binwidth to 2.5.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS)) +
  geom_dotplot(binwidth=2.5,
               dotsize = 0.5) +
  scale_y_continuous(NULL,
                     breaks= NULL)
```

## geom_histogram

In the code chunk below, [*geom_histogram()*](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html) is used to create a simple histogram by using values in *MATHS* field of *exam_data*.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth=10,color='white')
```

Note that the default bin is 30.


## Modifying a geometric object by changing *geom()*

In the code chunk below,

-   *bins* argument is used to change the number of bins to 20,
-   *fill* argument is used to shade the histogram with color, and
-   *color* argument is used to change the outline colour of the bars

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(x= MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20,            
                 color="black",      
                 fill="#7F948F")  
```

## Modifying a geometric object by changing *aes()*

The code chunk below changes the interior colour of the histogram (i.e. `fill`) by using sub-group of `*`aesthetic()`*`.

`scale_fill_manual()` allow you to specify your own set of mappings from levels in the data to aesthetic values.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS,
           fill = GENDER)) +
         geom_histogram(bins =20,
                        color='grey40')+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E1C8C4","#7F948F"))
```

This approach can be used to colour, fill and alpha of the geometric.


## geom_density

[`geom-density()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_density.html) computes and plots [kernel density estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_density_estimation), which is a smoothed version of the histogram.

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.

The code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS)) +
  geom_density(color='#7F948F')
```

The code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using *colour* or *fill* arguments of `aes()`.

Changes:
-   *color* within geom_density needs to be removed.
-   added *fill* and *color* within `aes()`
-   `scale_color_manual()` for changing line color
-   `scale_fill_manual()` for changing area fill colors.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x=MATHS,
           fill = GENDER,
           color=GENDER)) +
  geom_density(size=2, 
               alpha=0.6)+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E1C8C4","#7F948F"))+
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#E1C8C4","#7F948F"))
```

## geom_boxplot

[`geom_boxplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html) displays continuous value list. It visualises five summary statistics (the median, two hinges and two whiskers), and all "outlying" points individually.

The code chunk below plots boxplots by using [`geom_boxplot()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_boxplot.html).

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y=MATHS,
           x=GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

[Notches](https://sites.google.com/site/davidsstatistics/home/notched-box-plots) are used in box plots to help visually assess whether the medians of distributions differ. If the notches do not overlap, this is evidence that the medians are different.

The code chunk below plots the distribution of Maths scores by gender in notched plot instead of boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE)
```

## geom_violin

[`geom_violin`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_violin.html) is designed for creating violin plot. Violin plots are a way of comparing multiple data distributions. With ordinary density curves, it is difficult to compare more than just a few distributions because the lines visually interfere with each other. With a violin plot, it's easier to compare several distributions since they're placed side by side.

The code below plot the distribution of Maths score by gender in violin plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_violin()
```

## geom_point

[`geom_point()`](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_point.html) is especially useful for creating scatterplot.

The code chunk below plots a scatterplot showing the Maths and English grades of pupils by using `geom_point()`, grouped by gender.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= ENGLISH,
           color = GENDER)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#E1C8C4","#7F948F"))
```

## Combination of geom objects

The code chunk below plots the data points on the boxplots by using both `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_point()`.

**Important**: order of geom layer matters! In the code below, boxplot is plotted afer/above the scatter and thus covers parts of the scatterplot.

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +

  geom_point(position = 'jitter',
             size=0.5) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data, 
       aes(y = MATHS, 
           x= GENDER)) +
  geom_boxplot() +                    
  geom_point(position="jitter", 
             size = 0.5)        
```
