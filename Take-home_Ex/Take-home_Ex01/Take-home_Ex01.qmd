# 1 Overview

## 1.1 Background

The OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) surveys collected data on students' performances in reading, mathematics and science, as well as contextual information on students' background, home characteristics and school factors which could influence performance. This could be used to create shared points of reference, to leverage peer pressure and spur collaboration to act on the data. The goal of PISA was to help schools and policy makers shift from looking inward at each other within the same education system to looking outward: to teachers, schools and policy makers across the world.

## 1.2 The Data

The data for this exercise is the **Student questionnaire data file** in SAS format, retrieved from [OECD's PISA 2022 Database](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/2022database/).

## 1.3 The Task

Using the **2022 Student Questionnaire Dataset**, this exercise aims to use appropriate Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods and ggplot2 functions to reveal:

-   the distribution of [Singapore students']{.underline} performance in **mathematics, reading, and science**, and
-   the relationship between these performances with **schools, gender and socioeconomic status** of the students.

The code chunk below uses `p_load()` of [**pacman**](https://rpubs.com/akshaypatankar/594834) package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

# 3 Importing PISA Data

Import the *2022 Student Questionnaire* dataset downloaded from the OECD's PISA 2022 Database by using the [`read_sas()`](https://haven.tidyverse.org/reference/read_sas.html) function of the [**haven**](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package.

**Visual Considerations**

-   Raincloud plots are used to capture the density and range of values by expense, with dotplots beneath the half-density plots revealing patterns in consistency\
-   Separate plots were coded for -ve and +ve transactions, with Education, Food & Recreation and Shelter separated as well. This is due to the wide scale of y-axis values, which made the narrower denIt extends ggplot2 with:
    -   interactive `geom` functions: `geom_point_interactive()`, `geom_col_interactive`, etc.

    -   interactive `scale` functions: `scale_color_continuous_interactive()`, `scale_fill_manual_interactive()`, etc.

    -   interactive `facet` functions: `facet_wrap_interactive()` and `facet_grid_interactive()` that both work with `labeller_interactive()`.

    -   interactive `guide` functions: `guide_colorbar_interactive()`, `guide_colourbar_interactive()`, `guide_legend_interactive()`.

    -   interactive `theme` elements: `element_line_interactive()`, `element_rect_interactive()`, `element_text_interactive()`, `label_interactive`.sity plots too condensed for the distribution to be viewed in full.\
-   `patchwork` package was used to group the plots together in a single figure, using `plot_layout(heights)` to configure height ratio of the overall patched plots

**Initial Insights from Line Chart and Table**

-   Expenditure on education is the lowest, and has remained constant \> probably refers to school fees, which is normally a fixed monthly amount
-   Expenditure on recreation and food shows monthly variation, and have decreased from Apr 2022 to Feb 2023
-   Expenditure on Shelter is significantly higher that other categories, and also remains constant \> probably refers to rent

These may be grouped together by percentile, and analysed as age groups instead to give a better overview of different demographics. Each band represents sequential 20th percentiles:

-   **Lowest 20th Percentile: 18-26**
-   **20-40th Percentile: 27-35**
-   **40-60th Percentile: 36-44**
-   **60-80th Percentile: 45-52**
-   **Top 20th Percentile: 53-60**
